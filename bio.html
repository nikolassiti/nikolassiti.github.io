          <h1>How My-Bio Started?</h1>
          <p class="bio__text">Hello, my name is Nick. I am originally from Ukraine, but imigrated to U.S. at the age of 17. Well, I got married young, at the age of 20.
            I took over the financial responsibility for my family without a chance to graduate college. So, I started to do what I was able to do the best -
            construction jobs. I was building new houses and do full remodel, as well as just minor home projects. However, evenings and weekends I
            always tried to find time for myself, for my hobby - computers. One day, my wife brought me the idea of going back to college so I can do
            what I love instead of what I am supposed to or expected to do. By that time, my wife already graduated college, our youngest child was three,
            and our financial situation was better. I was debating at the beginning the idea of spending time in school instead of holding a job, but not
            long time was needed for me to realize that I can transform my hobby into my job. So, I took the leap and went to school for my A.S. in Computer
            Science. Now, I can truly say that I am Blessed - earn money by doing what your heart loves and having by your side people who help you
            realize and transform your dreams into reality. Computers, web desing, programming - is what I love, and by doing what you love, you thrive
            to do better and better everyday.
